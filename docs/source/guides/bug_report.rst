Bug report
==========

The platform is still in an experimental stage and under development. If you encounter a bug that you want to report, you can do it directly by using the integrated bug report tool.
It is symbolized by the |bug_report| button on the top right of the screen.

Please fill the report with as much details as possible to let us identify the bug you've encountered.
