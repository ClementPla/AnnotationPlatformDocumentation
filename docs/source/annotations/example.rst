Annotations examples
=====================

We present here some images annotated during the first annotation phase (out of 200 images from the Messidor database). The annotations were done collaboratively by 8 retinal specialists, starting from pre-annotations predicted using deep-learning based methods.

        Here, it appears that some vessels in the right lower quadrant have been partially annotated as hemorrhages. This is probably an error in the pre-annotation algorithm that has not been corrected.
