What's our project?
========================
This project emerges from a collaboration between the Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont (**HMR**), Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (**Mila**)​, Diabetes Action Canada (**DAC**) and our team at the LIV4D laboratory in Polytechnique Montréal.

* Our goal is to collect a large annotated database of fundus images in order to train machine learning algorithms to predict early stage of diabetic retinopathy. 

* Specifically, we want to investigate deep-learning based solutions to facilitate screening of early DR onset and increase the capacity of telemedicine programs.

* **In practice**, this means overcome the technical challenges preventing state of the art screening models from being successfully applied in this context.

* To facilitate the communication between retinal specialists and our computer vision team, we have launched an online platform developed to collect and annotate retinal images.

Core features of the software are:

* Web-based application​
* Retinal images anonymized and stored securely on an institutional server​
* Labelling of biomarkers & disease grading.
